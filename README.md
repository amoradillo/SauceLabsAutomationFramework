# SauceLabsAutomationFramework

This Maven Project employs the Page Object Model design pattern, utilizing Selenium, Java, TestNG, Maven, Git, Extent Reports, and Log4j. It serves as my project aimed at enhancing my skills and knowledge.

# Functionality 
Automation Flow covers the following processes: 
1. Login Functionality
2. Add to Cart Functionality
4. Checkout Process
5. Logout Functionality
6. Multiple User Login Functionality

# Frameworks and Tools Used:
   * Selenium WebDriver - a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms.
   * TestNG (Test Unit Framework)   - a testing framework that is inspired by JUnit and NUnit but introduces some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easy to use. All the functional tests are created using TestNg @Test annotations in the src/test/java 
     folder.
   * Extent Reports - widely-used open-source reporting library in the Java and .NET ecosystems for creating interactive and customizable test reports in automated testing frameworks, particularly in the context of Selenium WebDriver-based test automation.
   * Maven (Build Automation Tool) -used as a building automation and project management tool. Maven is a POM (project object model) based build automation and project management tool written in Java. Maven is widely used for dependency management in Java. It also 
   * provides a predefined folder structure to write the code. We can add different plugins and JARs to our project.   
   * Apache POI API (Read-Write utilities for Excel - Test Data Handling) 
   * IntelliJ - IDE 
   * Browser - Chrome, Mozilla and Edge

## Why Page Object Model?
    1) Helps with easy maintenance.
    2) Helps with reusing code.
    3) Readability and Reliability of scripts
    4) Provides structure to the Automation Framework

## How to Run the tests

## Pre-requisite:
   * JDK 8 and above.
   * Chrome browser - latest version installed.
   * Maven is installed in the machine and configured properly.
   * Eclipse IDE or IntelliJ IDEA can be used to run test cases using testng.xml suite files.
